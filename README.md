This is hardware for a HT1632C LED matrix driver, an optional driver and a common cathode or common anode led 60x60mm led matrix.<br>
SJ1 - according to the datasheet you can connect the chip's OSP pin either to GND or VCCIO, don't know for what it's good<br>
SJ2 - connect to VCCIO if you drive the logic side from separate power, else to VCC<br>
SJ3 - connect to VCC if you have a common anode matrix, to GND if common cathode<br>
